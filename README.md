# Restaurants Daya Analysis in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
[Data Science Capstone Project] 
- Using Jupyter Notebook and Python Language

Objective: 

Purpose of this project was to identify Kuala Lumpur areas with information of restaurants in order to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location and a suitable type of restaurant. 

By calculating restaurant density distribution from Foursquare data we have first identified general boroughs with different types of restaurants. Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest by particular ethnic group, and to be utilized as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders. 

Hence, final decision on optimal restaurant location is able to made by stakeholders based on specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone.
